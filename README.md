# Learning-Android-Dev

Hey there, thanks for checking out my repository! This repository contains all of the projects I've made while learning Android development, mostly course material that I coded myself. Each project states exactly what I learned while creating that project.

Keep in mind that many of these projects are NOT optimized, contain messy code, have no comments, use bad design patterns, and so on. This is to show my learning process and most of these projects were finished in one day or less.
